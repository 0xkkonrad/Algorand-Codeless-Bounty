# Executive Summary (aka TLDR)

This is an outline of a events-based marketing strategy to bring Degens to the Algorand ecosystem. Degens fall into two categories: technical and business categories. Technical degens are well-addressed by Hackathon-based coding challenges, whilst business-minded degens are attracted by codeless tasks or opportunities to team up with technical degens. 

The marketing strategy leverages the multiple high-profile partnerships that Algorand has through a series of thematic hackathons. Themes revolve around the specific ecosystem needs and opportunities of a given partner. By spreading efforts over multiple smaller events, more deeply specialised participants are attracted. Furthermore, the higher level of applicability increases the chances of useful hackathon outcomes, rather than casual submissions.    

The outline provides guidance for the scheduling, budgeting, best practices, and marketing of the hackathon series. 

<aside>
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Build a long-lasting high-value Algorand Degen (technical and business) community.

Key Results: The objectives are set at $500 CAC for hackathon submissions and $3k CAC for high-potential community contributors (hackathon winners), engagement measured 1 month post-hackathon.

Initiatives: A 6-month monthly hackathon series budgeted at $50k and a total budget of $300k + incidentals.

# Background

For any L1 and infrastructure project, the commercial strategy must involve capturing the interest of developers and businesses who will take advantage of its infrastructure. In terms of crypto enthusiasts, these fall into two attractive groups: tech degens and business degens. The third category of retail degens is not attractive, because they are not a sustainable source of innovation and growth. Tech degens are developers, theyâ€™are motivated by ease of use, universality and community quality. Business degens are interested in commercial applicability and development costs on Algorand.

The former are have general blockchain awareness and are very optimistic about the future of the technology. They may have heard about Algorand but are not necessarily sure about how the feature set compares to other L1 ecosystem landscapes. They have no software development skills but can engage with blockchain technologies through non-coding tools, exchanges, dapps, etc. These individuals are characterised by a deep excitement about business and social appiclications reaching far into the future.

The latter are software developers with some knowledge of blockchain technologies. Similarly, hey might be aware that Algorand exists but are not necessarily sure about how the feature set compares to other ecosystems. They are primarily excited about technology and will be convinced by ecosystem advantages, such as a large dev community or great documentation.  

The community of degens is best addressed through events, whether virtual or physical. A key persona to drive the community are technical degens, who are able to build applications on Algorand. They are the drivers of innovation and are their applications are in turn drivers for adoption if they succeed attracting business-minded degens and designers.

Degens are best addressed through events-driven marketing, such as hackathons and conferences. Events are the best tool for community building. Well-executed event series can spawn entire ecosystems because they are:

- inspirational - increased ecosystem transparency through exchange of information can inspire institutional leaders to follow early adopters
- networking platforms - creating business opportunities through direct networking
- knowledge exchanges - talks and workshops exchange knowledge about new developments and best practices

Tech degens are attracted by beautiful documentation and a lively dev community. The multipliers in this space are builders. Businesses and institutional solutions built on Algorand have strong network effects. They attract or bring in end users. For many solutions, such as p2p payments, adoption will have network effects and lock-in similar to communicators. More importantly, development expertise has a strong network effect, because technologies and skills are shared within the community. 

Especially in FOSS-centric communities, dev activity has strong economies of scale. Technologies are shared between devs, thereby sharing the R&D across the entire pool, without the parallelized efforts common in closed systems. Large institutional solutions which may on always be FOSS-compatible also benefit from a large FOSS community indirectly. On top of the shared technologies, FOSS communities can be a great source of talent, because contributions can often be traced to individual devs, thereby identifying talent easily and providing a strong top of the funnel for hiring.

However, awareness of technological features must come with a strong business or policy application. This must come from raised awareness amongst business and policy leaders. Here, network effects are weaker as individual applications may not have strong influence. For instance, a CBDC in one country will not strongly influence a CBDC in another. However, wider adoption does come with raised awareness and risk-taking early adopters may serve as proof of concepts for wide adoption. 

## Building a Community

<aside>
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Creating a top of the funnel for high-value community members.

Key results: Post-hackathon engagement at 50% of the prize winners one month after the hackathon

Initiatives: A series of hackathons that attract technical and business degens.

</aside>

Hackathons and conferences give an easy opportunity to present Algorand and as an attractive ecosystem to devopers and technical degens. Hackathons encourage participants to interact with the technology on a deep level, which raises awareness of Algorandâ€™s value proposition and results in direct interaction with the Algorand ecosystem. In other words, by exposing junior builders to the advantages of particular features directly, one can win them for the long run. There are several positive effects:

- Hackathon winners sometimes become actual businesses as the initial validation from the community helps undecisive founders to commit. Furthermore, cash prizes can help with initial bootstrapping expenses.
- Team formations often happen at hackathons. By working together people get to know each other and sometimes decide to work together in the long run.
- Developerss have to get hands-on with the actual technology and its documentation. This provides a fast-paced learning environment.
- Hackathons are inspiring. The time limitation and zero capital expenditure force devs to be extremely creative.

Whilst hackathons are great ways of attracting devs, they are not commonly used to attract business leaders and designers. This seems like a missed opportunity that Algorand recognises to some extend with codeless bounties. There is a lot of room to expand this.

In order to attract holistically composed teams and spark interest amongst non-technical degens, hackathon judgement criteria should have a strong bias towards design and business, having judgement criteria such as:

- business viability
- branding
- time to launch MVP
- use of Algorand-specific technology
- capitalising on Algorand-specific value propositions (e.g. sustainability).

Furthermore, communications should emphasise the importance of a business-minded pitch and presentation. These should be clearly differentiated from start-up pitching, which talk about large addressable markets. In this case, small projects that have utility should be welcomed.

ðŸ’¡ Community managers should engage participants regularly after the event

### Winners

The winners should be picked not necessarily according to best project, but to the highest potential of being high-value and long-lasting Algorand community members. 

### Building Long-Lasting Relationships

The purpose of the hackathons is to build relationships with the winners of the hackathons, who are promising degens. The taks is not completed when when the hackathon winners are announced. This is the starting point of a long-lasting relationship with the winners that needs nurturing.

This accelerated marketing funnel, where participants will jump from awareness to evaluation within a very compacted timeframe. Once participants are signed up, the relationship-building efforts start. The goal is to have long-lasting ecosystem participants who will stay with Algorand. 

It is not uncommon to see participants win and not become part of the ecosystem. For all sales and partnership purposes, the hackathon winners should be be treated as the top of the funnel, not the end of it. It is a common marketing mistake to host hackathons, distribute prizes and then never to follow up.

### Event Schedule

The most fruitful hackathons are short and intense experiences. Monthly hackathons will attract more participants, but engagement will not be as deep, and many submissions will be project that would be built any way, independently of the hackathon itself. 

Shorter hackathons are more intense experiences which means engagement will be much higher. They also do not allow for high complexity and multi-feature projects, This forces participants to take advantage of very specific features, especially if judgement criteria emphasise that. 

A week long or 72h weekend hackathon seem to be optimal for this. They allow for devs with full-time jobs to meaningfully join, whilst not being too short to do research and learn about completely new solutions enough to ship simple single-feature applications.

To maximise engagement mid-event checkins and mini-presentations of progress should be part of the hackathon. Regular progress updates will encourage knowledge sharing and inter-team networking at the Algorand hackathon. 

Timing is also important and summer holidays are the best time for hackathons as work loads are generally lower. However, smaller hackathons can be done all-year round.  

### Leveraging Partnerships

Algorand is uniquely equipped to host partnered hackathons with key strategic partners. Algorandâ€™s broad and rich portfiolio of large institutional partnerships creates the perfect opportunity for application-specific hackathons. The following partnership and theme proposals serve as examples: 

- A FIFA-partnered hackathon themed around the use of blockchain technology in sports and entertainment, with Rand Gallery and AlgoxNFT as key partners.
- An hackathon with large environmentalist organizations themed around sustainable asset management and transparency
- An Nigeria-partnered hackathon revolging around IP rights tokenization and corresponding marketplaces, with Spindle, Rand Gallery and AlgoxNFT as key partners.

Such themed hackathons attract fewer participants, but create a much stronger community because of the definite participant profile. This community has stronger effects such as knowledge sharing and business networking.

ðŸ’¡ Algorand has institutional partners who will co-benefit from the hackathons.

### Marketing Partnered Hackathons

Key communities and their communication channels must be identified. For the IP hackathon, these could be:

- The Nigerian degen community, which is addressable through other Blockchain events, telegram and discord groups.
- IP rights specialists to give talks or participate can be addressed through law firms and think tanks.
- Tokenization specialists.
- Top engineering and compsci universities.

Addressing these specialists to give talks, host workshops, and participate will create the basis for high quality teams and submissions at the hackathon. Furthermore, in order to attract designers and business-minded degens, their broader community should be addressed.

The most efficient way of addressing such varied and fragmented communities is by cold outreach campaigns to community leaders, such as event organisers, academics and industry specialists. To leverage their multiplier potential, the call to action should be to forward event and prize information to relevant community members, with a secondary CTA of hosting a talk. 

### Prizes & Rewards

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Having many tracks and smaller prizes ($1-5k) optimises for more specialised engagement and dedicated work.

</aside>

Prizes should be distributed in multiple smaller tracks, such as:

- best application of ASCs
- best sustainability case
- best NFT project
- best infrastructure, etc.,

as well as partnership specific ones, e.g.:

- Best IP rights marketplace
- Best escrow for IP rights transfers, etc

High cash prizes are strong incentives, but they are not long-lasting. Winning a hackathon should be treated as the start of a relationship that must be taken care of.

A great way of building a long-lasting relationship is to include future event rewards in the prizes. For instance, flights and hotels to a real-life Algorand event, or inviting winners to give talks at the next virtual event. These are cheap but highly engaging ways of building a relationship with these warm leads. 

For submissions that could be the basis of becoming companies, partnerships with VC-backed accelerators or expand Algorandâ€™s own accelerator offering to include pre-seed financing.

## Beautiful and Hackathon-friendly Documentation

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The faster participants can get to work, the greater the results at the hackathon will be.

</aside>

Documentation goes beyond the scope of this marketing campaign, however a brief outline will be provided to emphasise its important. Also, documentation and quality content is relatively cheap to build. 

Good documentation can be a strong driver for adoption.  A useful case study is that of Stripe. The early success of Stripe can be attributed primarily to the ease of implementation because of the dev-first mindset that was adopted. A large part of the success was a simple API, a beautiful and simple documentation, and many tutorials on implementing Stripe.

If devs find it pleasant and efficient to work with Aldorand, then they will push for adoption internally. They are key stakeholders on any decisions about tech stacks, so winning them can mean a strong internal push towards adopting Algorand.

Algorandâ€™s documentation is already very good and could easily be leveraged by hosting workshops and online courses on using Algorand. Chainlink has excelled in creating high engagement videos and tutorials. 

Tutorials shoud include mini-apps and repositories for boilerplate versions of common applications, such as escrow, marketplaces and other dapps, with ready-made integrations for Pera and MyAlgo. This will maximise application creativity and speed up onboarding, so that creators can focus on innovation, not understanding documentation and best practices.

## Budget

<aside>
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: A narrow highly-prequalified top of the funnel for high value community members.

Key results: An average acquisition (submitting project to hackathon) cost of $500, and $3k per winning team.

Initiatives: Large prize pools with many smalle prizes and deep post-hackathon engagement

</aside>

A 6-month campaign with one monthly themed event is a $300k budget.

|  | $ / hackathon |
| --- | --- |
| Project Manager | $10k |
| Key Account Manager | $5k |
| Community Manager | $5k |
| Prizes | $30k |

Role descriptions:

- KAM: Manages relationship with key partners and with high-value leads among hackathon winners
- Community Manager: markets event to multipliers, engages hackathon Discord communities.

Marketing should be done through coldmailing multipliers and partners (which is the most cost effective way). The large prize pool is justified in web3. Whilst these are proportions that unusual for web2 hackathons, where prize pools are much lower, the specificity of L1 infrastructure and the scarcity of blockchain talent, the high prize pools are justified.
